In embedded programming, "ADC DMA" stands for "Analog-to-Digital Converter with Direct 
Memory Access." This involves two key components: the ADC and the DMA controller.

    ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter): This is a peripheral device that converts an 
    analog signal (such as a voltage) into a digital value that can be processed by a 
    microcontroller or microprocessor. The conversion process typically involves sampling 
    the analog signal at a specific rate and quantizing the signal to produce a digital 
    representation.

    DMA (Direct Memory Access): This is a feature that allows peripherals to transfer 
    data directly to or from memory without involving the CPU. The DMA controller can 
    move data between memory and peripherals autonomously, freeing the CPU to perform 
    other tasks and increasing the efficiency of data transfers.

When combined, ADC DMA refers to a setup where the ADC performs analog-to-digital 
conversions, and the resulting digital data is transferred directly to memory using DMA. 
This approach offers several advantages:

    Efficiency: The CPU is not burdened with managing the data transfer, which can be 
    particularly important in real-time applications or systems with high sampling rates.
    Speed: DMA can transfer data quickly and with minimal latency compared to CPU-managed 
    transfers.
    Reduced Interrupt Overhead: Using DMA reduces the number of interrupts generated by 
    ADC data conversions, allowing the system to handle other tasks more efficiently.

How ADC DMA Works

    Configuration: The ADC and DMA are configured. This involves setting up the ADC for 
    the desired sampling rate, resolution, and input channels, as well as configuring the 
    DMA controller for the source (ADC data register) and destination (memory buffer) 
    addresses and the number of data points to transfer.

    Triggering: The ADC starts conversions based on a trigger (e.g., a timer, software 
    command, or external event).

    Conversion and Transfer: As the ADC converts the analog signal to digital values, 
    the DMA controller automatically transfers the data from the ADC data register to a 
    predefined memory buffer.

    Completion: Once the specified number of conversions and transfers are completed, 
    the DMA controller can generate an interrupt to notify the CPU that the data is ready 
    for processing, or the CPU can poll the DMA status.

Example Use Case

A typical use case for ADC DMA in embedded systems might be in a data acquisition system 
where multiple sensor readings need to be sampled and stored in memory for later 
processing. By using ADC DMA, the system can sample data continuously at a high rate 
without missing any samples and with minimal CPU intervention.
Summary

ADC DMA is a powerful technique in embedded systems that combines the capabilities of 
an analog-to-digital converter and a direct memory access controller to efficiently 
transfer large amounts of data with minimal CPU involvement. This technique is widely 
used in applications requiring high-speed data acquisition and processing.
